                NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a package manager for
                JavaScript and is the default package manager for the JavaScript
                runtime environment Node.js. NPM allows developers to easily
                install, update, and manage packages (libraries, frameworks, and
                tools) for their projects.

                Parcel and Webpack are both popular bundlers for JavaScript
                applications. A bundler is a tool that takes your code,
                transforms it, and bundles it into a single file that can be
                executed by a web browser.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                Parcel is a fast, zero-configuration bundler that supports many
                features out of the box, such as code splitting, tree shaking,
                and hot module replacement.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                Webpack is a more mature and widely-used bundler that requires
                more configuration, but offers a wide range of plugins and
                customization options.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                We need a bundler like Parcel or Webpack because modern web
                applications often consist of many small JavaScript files, which
                can lead to performance issues and slow page loads. A bundler
                helps to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce the number of HTTP requests</li>
                <li>Compress and minify code</li>
                <li>Improve page load times</li>

                subsequent builds by reusing previously compiled code. You can
                safely delete this folder if you need to, but it's recommended

            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                Tree shaking is a feature of bundlers like Parcel and Webpack
                that removes unused code from your project's bundle. This helps
                to reduce the bundle size and improve page load times. Tree
                shaking works by analyzing your code and removing any modules or
                functions that are not actually used.

            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature of bundlers like
                Parcel and Webpack that allows you to update your code without
                requiring a full page reload. When you make changes to your
                code, HMR swaps out the updated modules in your application
                without restarting the entire application. This helps to improve
                development productivity and reduce the time it takes to see
                changes in your application.

                Vite, Webpack, and Parcel are all popular bundlers for
                JavaScript applications. Each has its own strengths and
                weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use depends on your
                project's specific needs.

            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                The caret (<code>^</code>) and tilda (<code>~</code>) symbols
                are used in&nbsp;<code>package.json</code>&nbsp;to specify
                version ranges for dependencies.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                The caret (<code>^</code>) symbol indicates that the dependency
                should be updated to the latest version within the same major
                version range. For example,&nbsp;<code>^1.2.3</code>&nbsp;would
                update to the latest version within
                the&nbsp;<code>1.x</code>&nbsp;range.

            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                The tilda (<code>~</code>) symbol indicates that the dependency
                should be updated to the latest version within the same minor
                version range. For example,&nbsp;<code>~1.2.3</code>&nbsp;would
                update to the latest version within

            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                Script types in HTML refer to
                the&nbsp;<code>type</code>&nbsp;attribute of
                the&nbsp;<code>&lt;script&gt;</code>&nbsp;tag, which specifies
                the type of script being loaded. The most common script types
                are&nbsp;<code>text/javascript</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>module</code>,
                which specify whether the script should be loaded as a
                traditional JavaScript file or as an ES6 module.

            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                <strong>JSX</strong>&nbsp;JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax
                extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code
                in your JavaScript files. It's used to create React elements,
                which are then rendered to the DOM. JSX makes it easier to write
                React applications by providing a more concise and expressive
                way of creating UI components.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                <strong>React.createElement vs JSX</strong
                >&nbsp;<code>React.createElement</code>&nbsp;is a function that
                creates a new React element. It takes three arguments: the type
                of element, the props, and the children. For example:&nbsp;<code
                    >React.createElement('div', { className: 'container' },
                    'Hello World!')</code
                >.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                JSX, on the other hand, is a syntax sugar on top
                of&nbsp;<code>React.createElement</code>. When you write JSX
                code, it gets compiled
                to&nbsp;<code>React.createElement</code>&nbsp;calls. For
                example:&nbsp;<code
                    >&lt;div className="container"&gt;Hello
                    World!&lt;/div&gt;</code
                >&nbsp;is equivalent to
                the&nbsp;<code>React.createElement</code>&nbsp;call above.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                <strong>Benefits of JSX</strong>&nbsp;The benefits of using JSX
                include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Concise code</strong>: JSX allows you to write more
                    concise code, making it easier to read and maintain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easier debugging</strong>: With JSX, you can use the
                    browser's developer tools to inspect the DOM, making it
                    easier to debug your application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improved performance</strong>: JSX can improve
                    performance by reducing the number of DOM mutations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                <strong>Behind the Scenes of JSX</strong>&nbsp;When you write
                JSX code, it gets compiled into JavaScript code that
                uses&nbsp;<code>React.createElement</code>&nbsp;to create React
                elements. This compilation step is usually done by a transpiler
                like Babel or a bundler like Parcel.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                <strong>Babel &amp; Parcel role in JSX</strong>&nbsp;Babel is a
                transpiler that converts modern JavaScript code (including JSX)
                into older JavaScript syntax that can be executed by older
                browsers. Parcel is a bundler that takes your code, including
                JSX files, and bundles them into a single file that can be
                loaded by the browser.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                Both Babel and Parcel play a crucial role in making JSX work.
                Babel compiles JSX code into JavaScript code, while Parcel
                bundles the compiled code into a single file.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                <strong>Components</strong>&nbsp;In React, a component is a
                reusable piece of code that represents a UI element. Components
                can contain other components, making it easy to build complex
                UIs.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                <strong>Functional Components</strong>&nbsp;A functional
                component is a type of component that is defined as a pure
                function. It takes in props and returns a React element.
                Functional components are easier to write and reason about than
                class components.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">
                <strong>Composing Components</strong>&nbsp;Composing components
                means combining multiple components to create a new component.
                This is a key concept in React, as it allows you to build
                complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable
                components.
